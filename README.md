# Academico

## 📚 Project Description

Academico is a lightweight, AI‑powered study app that instantly generates quizzes, practice tests, and explanations for any subject. It’s built for students who want fast, focused, and effective studying without clutter, distractions, or complicated tools.

The app turns any topic into a full review session—multiple‑choice questions, written‑response prompts, and AI‑generated feedback—helping users actually understand what they’re learning instead of just memorizing.

## 🚀 How to Use the App

1. **Open Academico** and type any study request. Examples:

   * “Generate a 25‑question Algebra 1 review.”
   * “Create a practice test for the AP Human Geography Unit 3 exam.”
   * “Make 10 flashcards about mitosis vs. meiosis.”
2. Academico instantly generates:

   * Custom quizzes and tests
   * Answer keys
   * Written explanations
3. Review your answers and read the AI feedback to deepen your understanding.

The entire experience is simple, direct, and fast—perfect for studying at home, school, or on the go.

## 💻 How to Launch the Code Locally 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tttmmcode/Academico
   ```
2. Open the project in Firebase Studio or your preferred environment.
3. Run the local preview environment (Firebase Hosting or local emulator).
4. The app runs entirely client‑side—no external APIs or database required.

## ⚠️ Issues I Ran Into 

* Designing dynamic quiz generation **without relying on APIs** was challenging—everything had to work offline.
* Creating a clean UI that handled both written and multiple‑choice questions smoothly required multiple iterations.
* Keeping performance fast on all devices while still generating long quizzes took optimization work.
