# Academico

Academico is an AI-powered study tool that instantly generates quizzes, practice tests, and explanations for any subject. It’s built for students who want fast, focused, customizable study materials without the clutter of large chatbots or the need for external databases.

## Project Description

Academico helps students study more efficiently by letting them create multiple-choice quizzes, written-response questions, flashcards, and detailed explanations based on any topic they enter. The app runs entirely in Firebase Studio, keeping everything simple, responsive, and easy to launch.

The purpose of Academico is to give students a clean, accessible system where they can review content, test their understanding, and get instant feedback—all in one place.

## How to Use the App

1. Open Academico in your browser.
2. Enter any topic or prompt. Example: "Generate a 25-question quiz for my AP Human Geography exam."
3. Academico will instantly generate:

   * Multiple-choice questions
   * Written-response questions
   * Answer keys
   * Explanations and feedback
4. Press "New Quiz" to generate another set, or adjust the prompt for a different subject.
5. No login, no database, no setup required.

## How to Launch Locally 

1. Open Firebase Studio.
2. Upload all project files (index.html, script.js, styles.css) into the main project folder.
3. Click **Run** to launch the app.
4. The live preview window will display Academico, ready for use.

## Issues and Challenges 

* Designing a system that feels AI-powered without external APIs.
